# Dotfiles

Another attempt at managing the different dotfile profiles that I have in use spread around.

## Installation

_TODO_

## Installing a Profile

This isn't actually a thing that works yet, it's the end goal.

```sh
dot profile install --name=dev
```

## Watching for Changes in a Profile

This isn't actually a thing that works yet, it's the end goal.

```sh
dot profile watch --name=dev
```
